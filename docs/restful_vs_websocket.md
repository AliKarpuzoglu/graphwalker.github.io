# What's the difference running GraphWalker as a Restful vs. WebSocket service?

# Restful

 * Synchronous, which makes a client simple to imlement.
 * Can only serve 1 client.

# WebSocket
 
 * Asyncronous, which makes the client a bit more complicated to imlement.
 * Can serve several clients at the same time.
